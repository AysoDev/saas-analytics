**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
I often struggle to clearly communicate new feature ideas because the template is too generic. Itâ€™s hard to provide all the necessary details in a structured way.

**Describe the solution you'd like**  
I would like a pre-filled or guided template that includes examples for each section, so I can quickly and accurately submit a feature request.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**  
I have tried just writing freeform feature requests, but they often lack the details needed for the team to understand my request.

**Additional context**  
It would be helpful if the template included prompts or examples in each section, like sample problems or solutions, to guide users.
