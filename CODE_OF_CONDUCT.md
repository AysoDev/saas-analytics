# SaaS Analytics Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment
The SaaS Analytics team and community are made up of professionals and volunteers from around the world, working on every aspect of the project—including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.  

Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, but it can also lead to communication challenges. This Code of Conduct exists to make our community welcoming, productive, and inclusive. It applies to all contributors, maintainers, and users of the SaaS Analytics project.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the SaaS Analytics project or AysoDev, including GitHub, IRC, mailing lists, DSF events, Discord, and any other forums created by the project team. Violations outside these spaces may also affect a person’s ability to participate within them.

## Our Standards

- **Be friendly and patient.**  
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to support people of all backgrounds and identities, including race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.  
- **Be considerate.** Your work affects others, and others’ work affects you. Consider the consequences of your actions. Remember that English may not be everyone’s primary language.  
- **Be respectful.** Disagreements are natural, but they are no excuse for poor behavior. Personal attacks, harassment, or creating an unsafe environment will not be tolerated.  
- **Be careful with your words.** Harassment and exclusionary behavior are unacceptable. Examples include, but are not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language
  - Discriminatory jokes or language
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
  - Posting or threatening to post someone’s personal information (“doxing”)
  - Personal insults using racist, sexist, or otherwise offensive language
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Repeated harassment
- **Disagree constructively.** When disagreements occur, focus on understanding different perspectives and resolving issues respectfully. Blaming others does not help; collaboration and learning from mistakes do.
